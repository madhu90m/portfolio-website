    <h2>My Journey in Data Engineering</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most defining moments in my career came when I was leading the Spark 3 upgrade for a critical
      financial data platform on Azure. As the designated point-of-contact, I was tasked with coordinating across
      engineering, DevOps, and stakeholder teams—while facing the challenge of modernizing legacy pipelines
      under tight deadlines.
    </p>
    <p>
      I led a 7-member team, developed reusable PySpark modules, optimized job performance using Spark SQL and
      Delta Lake, and implemented CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions. This resulted in 30% improvement in
      performance and seamless migration completed within two months—without disrupting business operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      This experience not only honed my technical expertise in big data and cloud platforms like Azure and Databricks,
      but also strengthened my leadership skills in high-pressure, cross-functional environments. It's these experiences
      that fuel my passion for building scalable data solutions and mentoring teams to solve real business problems
      through innovation.
